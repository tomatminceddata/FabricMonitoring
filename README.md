For quite some time, I claimed that I’m a Microsoft Fabric/Power BI Sherpa, helping an organization (my colleagues) have a successful and safe journey (the definition of success follows in a short moment). I believe the foundation for a joyful journey is the proper configuration of the Microsoft Fabric/Power BI tenant settings (next to knowing some technical things). For this reason, I created (and still create) this solution. This solution is not final, and currently, I have no roadmap. Nevertheless, I think it’s a start.
